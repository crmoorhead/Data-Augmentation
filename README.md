# Data-Augmentation

The data augmentation process comprises of three step. First, define all the transformations permissable with associated probabiities and options with their associated probabilities if desired. The augment_settings function produces a dictionary output that defines the augmentation policy fully in a standard way and accept a number of possible input formats. This dictionary serves as an input to the choose_augment which samples from the distribution defined by the augmentation policy in order to apply it to images or batches of images. Once selected, this is applied by the apply_augment function.

__augment_settings(policy_dict,\*args,\*\*kwargs)__: The purpose of this function is to produce a standardised input for the choose_augment function that will give instructions about how we pick which policies are applied to each image. The output of this function has a standard dictionary form which will contains entries with keywords corresponding to names of transformations and values consisting of a standard dictionary form. There is one additional keyword "probs" which gives the probabilities of each transformation (including no transformations) being chosen. The standard dictionary form for each transformation consists of three keywords "main_args", "opt_args" and "opt_kwargs" which have values corresponding to the main arguments (that is, the compulsory inputs), the optional arguments and the optional keyword argument of that transformation. The details of each are given in dictionary form. "main_args" has two entries, "options" and "probs" which give the options for each of the compulsory arguments in the form of a list of lists and a one to one corresponding list of lists for the probability of each option. "opt_args" has the same two entries

While the output of this function is standard, the input is non-standard and can be designed in a such a way as to describe the augmentation policy in as simple a way as possible.
